# :iphone: AngularJS :iphone:

## Build	a	single page to-do	list,	mobile	web	application	using	Angular.js,	and	package	it	with	PhoneGap Build.	

Features	and	Instructions:	

1. Based	on	an	MVC	pattern.	My	JS	app	includes a	Model	(i.e.	scope),	a	View	(i.e.	HTML	file)	and	a	controller	(i.e.	in	a	separate	js	file).	
2. “To	Do”	items	are	displayed	in	a	simple	HTML	list.	
3. The	app	includes	a	form	to	add	list	items.	
4. Two-way	data	binding.	Adding	an	item	via	the	form	updates	the	model	and	therefore	immediately	updates	the	view.
5. A	config.xml	file	for	PhoneGap.
6. A	(customized)	default	icon.
7. Zipped	my	package	and	uploaded	to	a	PUBLIC	PhoneGap	project.
