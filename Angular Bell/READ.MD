Build	a	single page to-do	list,	mobile	web	application	using	Angular.js,	and	package	it	with	PhoneGap Build.	

Features	and	Instructions:	

1.	Based	on	an	MVC	pattern.	Your	JS	app	will	include	a	Model	(i.e.	scope),	a	View	(i.e.	HTML	file)	and	a	
controller	(i.e.	in	a	separate	js	file).	
2.	“To	Do”	items	will	be	displayed	in	a	simple	HTML	list.	
3.	The	app	will	include	a	form	to	add	list	items.	
4.	Two-way	data	binding.	Adding	an	item	via	the	form	will	update	the	model	and	therefore	
immediately	update	the	view.	Hint:	Use	Angular	directives.	
5.	A	config.xml	file	for	PhoneGap.	Hint:	At	the	same	level	as	your	index.html.	
6.	A	(customized)	default	icon.	
7.	Zip	your	package	and	upload	to	a	PUBLIC	PhoneGap	project.
