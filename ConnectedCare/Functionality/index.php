The following concept defines the scope for the ConnectedCare application and service. 
ConnectedCare – Smart Home would be a complete healthcare monitor (smartphone application with supporting website) that enables the client to live independently with the added reassurance to them, their relatives and caregivers. ConnectedCare aims to support the client across various systems and would be aimed at anyone living alone, but particularly the elderly or infirm.

</div> <!-- header -->


<div class="col-lg-7">

<p>

The concept would be to establish strategically locate sensors around the client’s home so that their daily movements could be tracked and monitored. These sensors would also be linked to a fitbit (or a similar bracelet device) that the client would wear. This could track the client’s heart rate, blood pressure, movement, pedometer, calorie intake and sleeping patterns. The fitbit tool would also link to an altimeter and mapping technology (Movidius) that would locate the person if they were fall or are debilitated, allowing emergency responders to identify their current location to be found.

<div class="col-lg-8">

<p>

The wearable tool would have <b>Bluetooth LE abilities and a portion of the client’s exterior surroundings</b> (such as their garden) would be covered by Bluetooth to allow for the largest range possible for monitoring and support. There would be no camera facilities within the client’s home as that would be deemed to be too intrusive but the ability to add such hardware would be possible later, if required. The software and monitoring feature would be able to coordinate with a number of additional apps including a ‘Med Minder’ computerised medicine box (that reminds the user to take their medications with a series of optional visual and/or auditory alerts). The information collected from ConnectedCare would be available to the client’s, named family members, primary caregivers and potentially medical professionals (if permission has been given by the client). This information could be accessed thought the supporting website once the user has logged into their private profile.

</div> <!-- header -->



<div class="col-lg-8">

<p>

The tool would offer an option to place an NFC chip in a smartphone to allow tags to be placed around the house to ease certain tasks. A tag on photos of family members allows the phone, when the photo is tapped, to dial that person’s number. Tags could also be placed in certain locations throughout the client’s home with a “Call Me” signal to family or emergency responders.

ConnectedCare would monitor the client’s movement in the house, and alert the primary caregiver if sensors indicated the user might be unwell or have fallen.

The client being supported would have control of who received the information provided although once set up if disconnected the distant receiver would receive an emergency notification.
