# Introduction to Web Programming

## Built a website with the team designer.

This assignment forms part of my Minor Project which was planned with three Project Managers and a designer.
I was required to base this project on the design given to me by my team designer.

Task: Develop a web site prototype of my minor project design.

My application includes a website containing a selection of html pages and a
sensible folder structure. 

1. Based on Bootstrap and jQuery.
2. A consistent navigation system (e.g. nav bar). The user should never feel lost or
unable to find their way to any of the main sections of our site, regardless of where
they enter the site or navigate to.
3. We had to use best practices when thinking about how our pages load i.e. JS, etc.
4. Our project includes a login page (HTML form). I use the POST method for this form to send details to a PHP script, described in point #5.
5. I created a PHP script to collect the data from my registration form. This script
must then insert the POST data into a MySQL database. I have used minimal sanitization of this data before passing it to the MySQL database.
6. My MySQL connection is based off MySQLi.
