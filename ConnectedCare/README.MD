## Built a website with the team designer.

This assignment forms part of my Minor Project which was planned with three Project Managers and a designer.
I was required to base this project on the design given to me by my team designer.

:clipboard: Task: Develop a web site prototype of my minor project design.

:bulb: The Idea: *"ConnectedCare - Smart Home is a support system for vulnerable individuals of living at home. It is the connecting of modern technologies with both the supporting community and the family that has lead to our name - ConnectedCare - Smart Home."*

My application includes a website containing a selection of html pages and a
sensible folder structure. 

1. Based on Bootstrap and jQuery.
2. A consistent navigation system (e.g. nav bar). The user should never feel lost or unable to find their way to any of the main sections of our site, regardless of where they enter the site or navigate to.
3. We had to use best practices when thinking about how our pages load i.e. JS, etc.
4. Our project includes a login page (HTML form). I use the POST method for this form to send details to a PHP script, described in point #5.
5. I created a PHP script to collect the data from my registration form. This script must then insert the POST data into a MySQL database. I have used minimal sanitization of this data before passing it to the MySQL database.
6. My MySQL connection is based off MySQLi.
