## Built	a	web	service.

I was asked to build	a	web	service	in	PHP.		While	the	data	that	I have	exposed	can	be	anything	of	my	
choosing,	it	was	suggested	that	my	output	matches	the	format	expected	by	my	mobile	app	from	the	
mobile	web	applications	module,	so	that	I	can	hook	both	applications	together	if	I	wish.

The	application	contains the	following:

* An	Object	Oriented	design	pattern,	using	at	least	two	classes	which	work	together.
* A	backend	database	from	which	my	output	is	produced.
* A	Web	API:		My	service	exposes	a	RESTful	API	which	can	be	called	over	HTTP.
* At	least	two	API	endpoints,	i.e.	two	types	of	return	object.
* JSON	output:		My	service	does	not	need	to	return	XML	data,	JSON	will	be	sufficient.  I had originally used XML but the assignment required that I use JSON instead.
